This project is a standalone repository hosting the Kubevirt plugin
for OpenShift Console.

## Opening issues

Please follow the steps below to open an issue for this repository.

### Ensure the issue doesn't already exist

Navigate to the [OpenShift Virtualization issues page](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/CNV/issues) and search for the issue using the search bar in the upper right-hand corner. If your issue doesn't exist you'll need to open a new one.

### Log into Jira

You must be logged in with a Red Hat account to open an issue. If you already have an account click the Log In button in the upper right-hand corner and enter your credentials. If you don't, follow the instructions [here](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5832311) to create one.

### Open an issue

Once you're logged in, navigate back to the [OpenShift Virtualization issues page](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/CNV/issues) and click the blue Create button in the top navigation bar to open the Create Issue form.

Enter a concise, but descriptive summary of the problem in the Summary field, provide the requested information in the Description field, and select 'CNV User Interface' from the Component/s dropdown menu. The information in the Description field is critical to ensuring a prompt fix, so please be thorough. 

Click the Create button at the bottom then click on the link in the alert that pops up on the right side of the screen to open the issue. Do this quickly as it won't be displayed for very long. Write down the issue ID (Ex: CNV-12345) so you can easily locate the issue later.

## Local development

### Option 1 (recommended):

Open two terminals and navigate to the kubevirt-plugin directory in both of them. The first terminal will run a containerized instance of console and the second will run the kubevirt-plugin. In case you are using Openshift, make sure to set the environment variable `BRIDGE_BRANDING=openshift` in both terminals before starting.

In the first terminal:

1. Log into the OpenShift cluster you are using.
2. Run `yarn start-console` OR `./start-console.sh` OR `./start-console-auth-mode.sh`.

In the second terminal:

1. Run `yarn && yarn dev`

NOTE: `./start-console-auth-mode.sh` is when authentication is needed, `start-console.sh`, ignores authentication.

### Option 2: Docker + VSCode Remote Container

Make sure the [Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
extension is installed. This method uses Docker Compose where one container is
the OpenShift console and the second container is the plugin. It requires that
you have access to an existing OpenShift cluster. After the initial build, the
cached containers will help you start developing in seconds.

1. Create a `dev.env` file inside the `.devcontainer` folder with the correct values for your cluster:

```bash
OC_PLUGIN_NAME=kubevirt-plugin
OC_PLUGIN_I18N_NAMESPACES=plugin__kubevirt-plugin
OC_URL=https://api.example.com:6443
OC_USER=kubeadmin
OC_PASS=<password>
```

2. `(Ctrl+Shift+P) => Remote Containers: Open Folder in Container...`
3. `yarn dev`
4. Navigate to <http://localhost:9000>

#### Cypress Testing inside the container

1. `yarn test-cypress-docker`
2. Navigate to <http://localhost:10000>
3. login with password `kubevirt` (no need for username)

### Option 3:

1. Set up [Console](https://github.com/openshift/console) and See the plugin development section in [Console Dynamic Plugins README](https://github.com/openshift/console/blob/master/frontend/packages/console-dynamic-plugin-sdk/README.md) for details on how to run OpenShift console using local plugins.
2. Run bridge with `-plugins kubevirt-plugin=http://localhost:9001/ -i18n-namespaces=plugin__kubevirt-plugin`
3. Run `yarn dev` inside the plugin.

## i18n

You should use the `useKubevirtTranslation` hook as follows:

```tsx
conster Header: React.FC = () => {
  const { t } = useKubevirtTranslation();
  return <h1>{t('Hello, World!')}</h1>;
};
```

For labels in console extensions files, you should use the format
`%plugin__kubevirt-plugin~My Label%`. Console will replace the value with
the message for the current language from the `plugin__kubevirt-plugin`
namespace. For example:

```json
{
  "type": "console.navigation/section",
  "properties": {
    "id": "admin-demo-section",
    "perspective": "admin",
    "name": "%plugin__kubevirt-plugin~VirtualMachines%"
  }
}
```

Note that you will need to include a comment in `utils/i18n.ts` like the
following for [i18next-parser](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-parser) to
add the message from console extensions files to your message catalog as follows:

```ts
// t('plugin__kubevirt-plugin~VirtualMachines')
```

Run `yarn i18n` to update the JSON files in the `locales` folder of the
dynamic plugin when adding or changing messages.

## Docker image

1. Build the image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t quay.io/kubevirt-ui/kubevirt-plugin:latest .
   ```
2. Run the image:
   ```sh
   docker run -it --rm -d -p 9001:80 quay.io/kubevirt-ui/kubevirt-plugin:latest
   ```
3. Push the image to the image registry:
   ```sh
   docker push quay.io/kubevirt-ui/kubevirt-plugin:latest
   ```

## Deployment on cluster

After pushing an image with your changes to an image registry, you can deploy
the plugin to a cluster by instantiating the template:

```sh
oc process -f oc-manifest.yaml \
  -p PLUGIN_NAME=kubevirt-plugin \
  -p NAMESPACE=kubevirt-ui \
  -p IMAGE=quay.io/kubevirt-ui/kubevirt-plugin:latest \
  | oc create -f -
```

Once deployed, patch the
[Console operator](https://github.com/openshift/console-operator)
config to enable the plugin.

```sh
oc patch consoles.operator.openshift.io cluster \
  --patch '{ "spec": { "plugins": ["kubevirt-plugin"] } }' --type=merge
```
